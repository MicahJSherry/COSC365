               <h2>Austria</h2>
                <hr />

                <p>
                    Austria offers alpine scenery, world-class museums, cobbled quaintness, and Wiener schnitzel. 
                    Unlike Germany, its industrious neighbor to the northwest, Austria is content to bask in its 
                    good living and elegant, opulent past as the former head of one of Europe's grandest empires.
                    Austrians tend to be relaxed, gregarious people who love the outdoors as much as a good cup of
                    coffee in a café.
                </p>

                <h2>Germany</h2>
                <hr />
                <p><img src="images/germany.jpg" alt="germany"></p>
                <p>
                    Germany is blessed with some of Europe's most high-powered sights. There's spectacular scenery — 
                    the jagged Alps, flower-filled meadows, rolling hills of forests and farms, and mighty rivers — 
                    dotted all over with castles and churches of every variety. In Deutschland's idyllic half-timbered 
                    villages, you can enjoy strudel at the bakery or sip a stein of beer while men in lederhosen play 
                    oompah music. 
                </p>

                <h2>Italy</h2>
                <hr />
                <p><img src="images/italy.jpg" alt="italy"></p>
                <p>
                    Italy has Europe's richest culture. After all, this nation is the cradle of European civilization — 
                    established by the Roman Empire and carried on by the Roman Catholic Church. As you explore Italy, 
                    you'll stand face-to-face with some of the world's most iconic images from this 2,000-year history: 
                    Rome's ancient Colosseum and playful Trevi Fountain, Pisa's Leaning Tower, Florence's Renaissance 
                    masterpieces (Michelangelo's David and Botticelli's Venus), and the island city of elegant decay — 
                    Venice. Beyond these famous sights, though, Italy offers Europe's richest culture. Traditions still live 
                    within a country that is vibrant and fully modern.
